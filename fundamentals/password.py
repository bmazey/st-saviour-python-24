    generate_password takes no arguments and produces a string
    which meets the following password complexity requirements:
        - the length of the password is 10
        - the first 5 characters are lower case letters
        - the next 4 characters are digits [0-9]
        - the final character is a symbol [!@#$%^&*]
        - it's relatively uncommon to generate the same password twice
